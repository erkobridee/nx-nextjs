# NxNextjs

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev/) ([v14.5.10](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/releases/tag/14.5.10))

ℹ️&nbsp;&nbsp;use the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16 LTS

## Goal

- check how the Next.js works with Nx

- define shared components and use on the applications

- define shared assets (also webfonts) to use on the applications

- load the webfont added to the nx workspace and define to use it on the root `tailwind.config.js`

## Documentation

## Project dependency graph

> **implicit** - means some sort of manual configuration

## Findings

- it was possible to use the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) inside of the nx workspace

  - [Sass: LibSass is Deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) - [sass package | npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)

  - the `TailwindCSS` support is handled through the [Postcss](https://postcss.org/) supported by the nx workspace

  - it was possible to have Tailwind configuration per application extending the `tailwind.config.js` from the root

- it was possible use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10 though the [Nx Next.js Plugin](https://nx.dev/latest/react/plugins/next/overview)

  - the Next.js files when we run the development mode, they were place on the `dists/apps/{app name}/`

    - when we run the build it updates the same folder

    - when we run the export to get the static version, that's generates a inner folder `/exported`

## CLI Commands

- cleanup cache and dist: `npm run clean`

### app - [nx react plugin](https://nx.dev/latest/react/plugins/react/overview)

- development: `nx serve app`

- build: `nx build app`

  - with the flag `--prod` that will do the optimizations for production

### nextjs - [nx next.js plugin](https://nx.dev/latest/react/plugins/next/overview)

- development: `nx serve nextjs`

- build: `nx build nextjs`

  - with the `NODE_ENV=production` that will trigger the Tailwind css purge

  - in case of deployment with the server side support from the Next.js, you need to the the current content from the folder `dist/apps/nextjs`

- test builded: `nx serve nextjs --prod`

  - this will work only after run the build

- export: `nx export nextjs`

## Development tip

- to make my life easier I have the current `node_modules` from the project mapped to the PATH env variable, that enables me to run the command `nx` directly, if you don't have if you must use the short cut mapped on the `package.json`, using it like `npm run nx ...` or it's also possible to use like `npx nx ...` (the `npx` will look into the local installed packages `./node_modules/` and on the global installed packages)

  - `./node_modules/.bin`
